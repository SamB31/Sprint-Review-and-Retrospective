# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

During the Final Project for this course, I applied agile and Scrum practices to develop the SNHU Travel application. In the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable, we analyzed the team's roles and contributions, the benefits of using Scrum artifacts, stakeholder engagement, team dynamics, and the effectiveness of the Scrum-agile approach. 

Now, reflecting on this experience, I can answer the following essential questions in the context of software development:

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To effectively implement user needs into a program, it is crucial to first understand what those needs are. Creating user stories is a helpful technique for achieving this. User stories are brief, informal descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. They allow us to capture user requirements in a clear and concise way, and to prioritize those requirements based on their value to the user. By focusing on user stories during the development process, we ensure that the program we build aligns with the user's needs and goals.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development using agile methodologies, which prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and iteration. Specifically, I hope to incorporate the Scrum framework into my future development work. This framework promotes close collaboration among team members, active stakeholder engagement, and a focus on delivering working software in short, iterative sprints. I believe that these practices will help me to deliver higher quality software products that better meet the needs of end-users.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development requires a combination of technical skills, communication skills, and interpersonal skills. A good team member is able to contribute to the development process by designing, implementing, testing, and debugging code. They also communicate clearly and frequently with their teammates, and actively seek and give feedback. Interpersonally, a good team member is empathetic, supportive, and collaborative, and is committed to working together to achieve shared goals. Finally, a good team member is open to learning and adapting, and is willing to take on new challenges and responsibilities in order to grow as a developer.
